### Angularjs coding Challenge

This repo is actually angularjs interview challenge.

You need to design dashboard similar to what is shown in this file - [challenge-AdminDashboard.pdf](./challenge-AdminDashboard.pdf)


### Solution

0. Do $npm install
1. Do $npm start to start the node server
2. I made api's in node/express. I gave delay in each api to simulate network latency
3. Starting point for node/express is server/server.js
4. Starting point for UI is client/dashboard-app/app/app-md.js
5. intentionally did not use grunt/gulp/livereloading to keep setup simple
7. There seems small CSS issue in my loading directive due to which "Loading...." message is not seen at two places in UI.
8. My CSS skills are not that good so please excuse me :)
9. I used ui-router  for routing and C3 for charting
10. Did coding in hurry so excuse me for not adding proper comments etc.
